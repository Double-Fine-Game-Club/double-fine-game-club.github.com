			<h1>Where</h1>

			<p>Docklands Park (southern block) - just across the river from the PAX Australia venue at the Melbourne Convention & Exhibition Centre (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=217958050382155956677.000505dbcd9578ad18671&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=m&amp;ll=-37.823091,144.950073&amp;spn=0.005932,0.010729&amp;z=16&amp;source=embed">bigger map</a>)!</p>
			<p>Situated on Harbour Esplanade in Docklands on the southern block of Docklands Park near the "Blowhole", there's play equipment, BBQ facilities and open space for pirates, psychic agents, metal heads, spelunkers, halloween enthusiasts and wayward spacefarers alike.</p>
			<p>There is a small shelter at the BBQ area, but if the weather gets too ugly, we'll fall back to the food court below the DFO Hub shopping complex adjacent to the Melbourne Convention & Exhibition Centre (<em>keep an eye on the <a href = 'https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23DFBBQ'>#DFBBQ</a> Twitter hashtag for updates</em>).</p>

			<p>The park is a short walk across the river (there's a foot bridge right next to the PAX Promenade building), and the Village Docklands/Harbour Esplanade stop is frequented by the 70, 71 trams as well as the 35, which is a "<a href = 'http://ptv.vic.gov.au/timetables/linemain/1112'>free tourist tram</a>".</p>
			<p><em>Since this is outside of the PAX Australia venue, attendees will need to ensure that they have their passes and photo ID so that they can get back in!</em></p>

			<p>If you're interested in having something to munch, bring your own food. Since Docklands Park is a public space, we won't be able to reserve or monopolise BBQ equipment, but if it's doable, we'll try to keep one meat-free.</p>

		<article id = 'why'>
			<h1>Why</h1>
			<p>It's not often that an international pop culture/gaming event happens in Australia that brings people together the way that PAX will. This is a great time for fans and communities to come together to meet new friends and celebrate the things they love.</p>
			<img class = 'leftImage' src = 'images/roo_photo.png' alt = 'One of those bouncy things.' title = 'One of those bouncy things.' style = 'transform: rotate(8deg);' />
			<p>With Double Fine not able to attend, setting a time and place to gather is the best way to bring local DF fans and PAX attendees from afar together.</p>
			<p>PAX Australia sold out very quickly, and there have been many people interested in a meetup who weren't able to get passes. Having something across the road from the showgrounds makes it accessible to those that missed out whilst still keeping it easy for PAX attendees to get to without missing out on PAX content due to travel time.</p>

			<h1>Who</h1>
			<img class = 'rightImage' src = 'images/cheese_chalice.png' alt = 'Cheese what runs the Game Club.' title = 'Cheese what runs the Game Club.' style = 'transform: rotate(-5deg);' />
			<p>This gathering has been coordinated by Australian Double Fine community members. People from DF (most notably Greg and Ron whilst he was still there) have been really supportive and even donated some gear to give away.</p>
			<p>If you come along, you'll get to meet:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ron Gilbert - PAX Australia keynote speaker, former Double Fine team member and creator of Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, DeathSpank and The Cave (amongst others)!</li>
				<li>Cheese - that fellow who coordinates the <a href = 'http://double-fine-game-club.github.io'>Double Fine Game Club</a>, keep an eye out for his antennae!</li>
				<li>Less wildlife than images on this page seem to suggest!</li>
				<li>And a whole bunch of super awesome Aussie DF fans!</li>
