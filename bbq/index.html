			<p>We'll have a whole bunch of Psychonauts and Brütal Legend Pinny Arcade badges. Be sure to grab one!</p>

			<p>In the leadup to the meetup, feel free to say hi/make plans/become friends in <a href = 'https://forums.doublefine.com/topic/16848-pax-australia-df-fan-meetup/'>this thread</a> on the Double Fine forums.</p>

		<article id = 'why'>
			<h1>Why</h1>
			<p>It's not often that an international pop culture/gaming event happens in Australia that brings people together the way that PAX does. This is a great time for fans and communities to come together to meet new friends and celebrate the things they love.</p>
			<p>With Double Fine not able to attend, setting a time and place to gather is the best way to bring local DF fans and PAX attendees from afar together.</p>

		<article id = 'who'>
			<h1>Who</h1>
			<img class = 'rightImage' src = 'images/cheese_chalice.png' alt = 'Cheese what worked on Day of the Tentacle.' title = 'Cheese what worked on Day of the Tentacle.' style = 'transform: rotate(-5deg);' />
			<p>This gathering has been coordinated by Australian Double Fine community members, but people from DF (most notably James Spafford) have been super supportive.</p>
			<p>If you come along, you'll get to meet:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Cheese - Double Fine community guy and Linux developer on Day of the Tentacle Remastered, keep an eye out for his antennae!</li>
				<li>Less wildlife than images on this page seem to suggest!</li>
				<li>And a whole bunch of super awesome Aussie DF fans!</li>
