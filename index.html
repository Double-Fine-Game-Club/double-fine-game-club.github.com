			<h1>What is Game Club?</h1>
			<img class = 'rightImage' src = 'images/dfgc_logo.png' alt = 'The Double Fine Game Club!' />
			<p>The Double Fine Game Club is a community run weekly event where members of the Double Fine community and other adventure game fans come together to play and talk about the game currently being played (think of it as a book club for games). It's entirely informal and everybody is welcome!</p>
			<p>Logs and further discussion can be found in specific Game Club threads on the <a href = 'http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewforum/22/'>Double Fine forums</a>.</p>
			<p>From time to time we've also been joined by developers of a game we've been playing for a Q&amp;A session.</p>

			<h1>How can I get involved?</h1>
			<p>It's easy!</p>
			<p>Just visit this page or log onto the #DFAdventure IRC channel on Foonetic.net at 7:00pm UTC (check the countdown timer at the top of the page, or visit <a href = 'http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Double+Fine+Game+Club:+Machinarium&amp;iso=20120818T12&amp;p1=137&amp;ah=2'>timeanddate.com</a> for your area) and chat about the game that's currently being played.</p>
			<p>If you don't own the game or aren't interested in playing it again, don't worry. We almost always have somebody streaming a playthrough which you can watch from this page.</p>
			<p>You can keep track of what's currently being played and join in on further discussion on the <a href = 'http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewforum/22/'>Double Fine forums</a>, and a list of Game Club threads is kept on the <a href = 'http://www.doublefine.com/dfa'>Double Fine Adventure Backer index</a> page.</p>

			<h1>Where can I find information on old Game Club sessions?</h1>
			<p>The Double Fine Game Club started out as an officially run community event for backers of the Double Fine Kickstarter project. Greg Rice of Double Fine, who passed the torch onto enthusiastic community members when he became less available. As a result, some of the earlier Game Club forum threads are only accessible to backers (if you missed out, you can still attain backer status from <a href = 'http://doublefine.com/dfa'>here</a>).</p>
			<p>We're still getting things sorted, so please be patient ^_^</p>
